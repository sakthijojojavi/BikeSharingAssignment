## General Information
- This project aims to understand the key factors that influence bike rental demand and develop a predictive model to help manage and optimize bike-sharing services.
- The background involves increasing urbanization and the need for efficient transportation solutions in cities.
- The business problem addresses how to predict bike rental demand accurately, allowing for better resource allocation and customer satisfaction.
- The dataset used includes variables such as weather conditions, holidays, seasons, and temporal factors affecting bike rentals.

## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Pandas 
- Scikit-learn 
- Matplotlib 
- Seaborn 
- Statsmodels 

## Conclusions
- Seasonal variations significantly impact bike rental demand, with summer showing higher rentals.
- Apparent temperature (atemp) is the most correlated numerical variable with bike rental counts.
- Weather conditions play a crucial role, with better weather leading to higher bike rentals.
- Holidays generally see a lower demand for bike rentals compared to regular weekdays.
